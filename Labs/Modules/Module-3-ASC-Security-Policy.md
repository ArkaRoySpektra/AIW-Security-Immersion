# Module 3 - Security Policy


## Overview

In this module, we will guide you through the current Security Center policies set by Azure. Also, we will walk you through the methods to enable or disable the Security policies. 

### Exercise 1: Overview of the ASC policy

In this exercise, You will get an overview of an index of Azure Policy built-in policy definitions related to Azure Security Center and about initiatives, policies, and how they relate to Security Center's recommendation.

1.	Launch **Azure Portal** using the desktop icon on the **JumpVM** and login with the Azure credentials from the Lab **Environment Details** tab if not logged in already.

2.	Type **Security Center** in the search box located on the top of the **Azure Portal** page and click on it.

3.	Click on **Security policy** from the left navigation pane under the Security Center section.

4.	On the Policy Management page, select **Azure subscription**.

5.	By default, there is 1 assignment at the **Security center default policy** which is **ASC default**.

![Security center default policy](../Images/asc-default-policy-subscription.png)

Note: This policy is enabled by default on your subscription as per Azure Security Center recommendations. This is the default set of policies monitored by Azure Security Center. It is automatically assigned as part of onboarding to Security Center. The default assignment contains only audit policies. For more information, please visit https://aka.ms/ascpolicies.

6.	To view the policy, click on **ASC Default**.

> ❗ Important: <br>
> You should see a different subscription GUID on your environment

7.	On the **Edit Initiative Assignment** page, click on **Parameters**.

8.	On the **Network Security Groups on the subnet level should be enabled**, change the action to **AuditIfNotExists** to enable monitoring of NSGs on subnets.

9.	Click on **Review + save**.

10.	On the Review tab, you can see your changes under the Parameters section: **networkSecurityGroupsOnSubnetsMonitoringEffect: AuditIfNotExists**

11.	Click on **Save**. Wait for the policy update to complete successfully.

### Exercise 2: Explore Azure Policy

Azure Policy keeps track of compliance for your Azure resources based on policy definitions you assign, these are called policy assignments. By default, Microsoft provides many built-in definitions that you can leverage as you see fit.

1.	Type **Policy** in the search box located on the top of the **Azure Portal** page and click on it. Alternately, you can navigate to the policy section by clicking on this link https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyMenuBlade.

2.	From the left navigation pane, under the **Authoring** section, click on **Definitions**. This is where you can explore the built-in policy definitions and initiatives.

3.	From the top menu, use the filter button and set the Category as **Security Center** and Definitions Type as **Initiative**

4.	You can now see two built-in initiatives used by Azure Security Center:
    -	*Azure Security Benchmark*
    -	*[Preview]: Enable Data Protection Suite*

![policy assignment](../Images/policy.png)

5.	Notice the number of policies included in each initiative (policies column)

6.	To see current assignments, click on **Assignment** from the left navigation pane. Policy initiatives have a different name for the assignment, for example:

    - *ASC Default (subscription: dd82589b-444c-45a8-863a-816243ce017d)*

7.	Click on **ASC Default** to see the assignment details.

### Exercise 3: Create resource exemption for a recommendation

Resource exemption will allow increased granularity for you to fine-tune recommendations by providing the ability to exempt certain resources from evaluation.
When working with a recommendation, you can create an exemption by clicking the ellipsis menu on the right side and then select create an exemption.

Note: Exemptions is a premium Azure policy capability that's offered for Azure Defender customers with no additional cost. For other users, charges may apply in the future.

1.	Type **Security Center** in the search box located on the top of the **Azure Portal** page and click on it.

2.	Select **Recommendations** from the left navigation pane.

3.	Go to bottom of page and expand **Secure management ports** security control from the list.

4.	Select the **Management ports should be closed on your virtual machines** recommendation.

![policy assignment](../Images/secure-management-ports.png)

   **Note**: If you don't see above option that means it is not loaded yet to control list, Note down this step number and verify this after some time.

5.	On the list of **Unhealthy resources** under **Affected resources**, see the current resources: *asclab-win* and *asclab-linux*.

6.	Select the **asclab-win** resource and then click on **Exempt**.

![Create exemption](../Images/asc-management-ports-resource-exemption.gif?raw=true)

7.	The create **exemption pane** opens:
    - Name: **ASC-Management ports should be closed on your virtual machines**.
    - Switch the **expiration** toggle button **ON** and set datetime for two days ahead on 12:00 AM.
    - Select **Waiver** as exemption category.
    - Provide a description: **Testing exemption capability – module 3**.
    - Click on **Create**.

![Exempt tab](../Images/exempt-scope.png)

> ⭐ Good to know: <br>
> **Mitigated** - This issue isn't relevant to the resource because it's been handled by a different tool or process than the one being suggested
> **Waiver** - Accepting the risk for this resource

8.	It might take up to **30 min for the exemption to take effect**. Once this happens:
    - The resource doesn't impact your secure score.
    - The resource is listed in the Not applicable tab of the recommendation details page
    - The information strip at the top of the recommendation details page lists the number of exempted resources: **1**

9.	Refresh tab and open the **Not applicable** tab to review your exempted resource – you can see our resource along with the reason/description value.

10.	Exemption rules are based on Azure Policy capability. Therefore, you can track all your exemptions from Azure Policy blade as well.

11.	Type **Policy** in the search box located on the top of the Azure Portal page and click on it. Next, select Exemptions from the left navigation pane. Notice your newly created exemption listed there.

![Exempttion tab](../Images/exemptions-policy.png)

### Exercise 4: Create policy enforcement and deny

In this exercise, you will learn how to use Azure Policy to do some of the more common tasks related to assigning, denying, and managing policies across your organization.

1.	Type **Security Center** in the search box located on the top of the Azure Portal page and click on it..

2.	From **Security Center sidebar**, select **Recommendations** under **General**.

3.	On recommendations filters, set the **Response actions** as **Deny**.

![Auditing on SQL server should be enabled](../Images/asc-recommendations-filters-deny.gif?raw=true)

4.	From the filtered recommendations list, select **Secure transfer to storage accounts should be enabled**.

5.	From the top menu bar, click on the **Deny** button. *Enforce and Deny options provide you another way to improve your score by preventing security misconfigurations*.

> ❗ Important: <br>
> Security misconfigurations are a major cause of security incidents.

![Secure Transfer](../Images/secure-transfer.png)

6.	On the **Deny - Prevent resource creation**, select your subscription (which is currently set to audit mode). This allows you to ensure that from now on, a storage account without the security transfer feature turned on will be denied. Click on **Change to Deny**.

![Prevent resource creation](../Images/asc-storage-deny-policy.gif?raw=true)

7.	Go back to the **recommendations view**, set the **Response action** filter as **Select All**. In the search box, type **Auditing**. Click on the recommendation **Auditing on SQL server should be enabled**.

![Auditing on SQL server should be enabled](../Images/asc-auditing-sql.gif?raw=true)

8.	On the **Auditing on SQL server should be enabled** page, from the top menu bar, click on the **Enforce** button. This option allows you to take advantage of Azure policy’s DeployIfNotExist effect and automatically remediate non-compliant resources upon creation.

9.	Once the configuration pane opens with all of the policy configuration options, select the following configuration settings:

* On Scope, select your subscription.
* Click **Next**
* Keep retention days as it is and select the resource group **asclab**
Select **Review + create** to assign the policy to your subscription.
* Click **Create**

![Sql Auditing](../Images/auditing-create.png)

![Sql Auditing](../Images/auditing-create1.png)

10. On the **Auditing on SQL server should be enabled** page, **select** the SQL Server resource found on the **unhealthy resources** tab of **Affected resources**(asclab-sql-xxx here xxx is the unique ID) and click **Remediate**. Change the retention days parameter to 180 and then click **Remediate 1 resource**. By doing both operations, you can now ensure your existing resources and new ones will be enabled for auditing. Auditing on your SQL Server helps you track database activities across all databases on the server and save them in an audit log.
